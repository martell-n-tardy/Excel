# Pacific Brands
A case study ....

## Introduction
Pacific Brands, a leading Australian manufacturer of women’s undergarments has experienced declining sales at a time that it was exploring introduction of two new
brassiere products. A key issue was whether to target the two products to separate segments.

## Business Problem
The case is set in 2009-2010. Pacific Brands Group (PBG) had sales of over $1 billion AUD, but sales had declined 5.2% in the past year, and profits were down 0.9%, and global and Australian economic situation looked bleak.

The case is about the company’s Berlei luxury brand which had just launched two new bras, Infinity and Timeless, both targeted to fashion conscious customers. However, it was unclear whether it made sense under the economic environment to target the two products to different customer segments. Also, the CFO and CMO are at odds about the costs and benefits of developing a segmented marketing program for the two products.

## Methodology
Cluster analysis helps you to determine the different segments in the market, and to profile the segments.
