# Pacific Brands
Pacific Brands, a leading Australian manufacturer of women’s undergarments has experienced declining sales at a time that it was exploring introduction of two new
brassiere products. A key issue was whether to target the two products to separate segments.

## Business Problem
The case is set in 2009-2010. Pacific Brands Group (PBG) had sales of over $1 billion AUD, but sales had declined 5.2% in the past year, and profits were down 0.9%, and global and Australian economic situation looked bleak.

The case is about the company’s Berlei luxury brand which had just launched two new bras, Infinity and Timeless, both targeted to fashion conscious customers. However, it was unclear whether it made sense under the economic environment to target the two products to different customer segments. Also, the CFO and CMO are at odds about the costs and benefits of developing a segmented marketing program for the two products.

## Objective
The primary task is to identify and define the segments within the brassiere market and recommend cost-effective advertising and promotional activities that the Berlei team can execute to promote Infinity and Timeless. 

## Methodology
  1. What are the key segments of brassiere shoppers, according to differences in consumers’ physical, psychological, and retail-experience needs?
  2. Does it make sense for PBG to target specific segments to increase sales for Timeless and Infinity? If so, summarize the strategic rationale for the       segmentation strategy and specify the segments that PBG should target. If not, explain why not.
  3. What specific advertising and retailing programs would allow the company’s new brassiere offerings, Timeless and Infinity, to target their potential respective consumers most effectively?
  4. Based on your analysis, develop a strategy brief for Sue Morphet, explaining how she should address the concerns of her CFO and CMO.

## Deliverables
A slide deck presentation defining: 
* 3 key segments of consumers (“Excitable Orthodoxs”, “Millennial Divas”, and “Youthful Thrifties”)
* 7 reasons, with explanations, of why Pacific Brands should not target specific segments at this time.
* Infinity will focus on data media in the form of Social Media Marketing, Online Advertising, SEO, PPC, and a Content Strategy.
* Timeless will focus on other marketing strategies applied under content marketing, such as PR, Brand Well, Fashion Week, Radio, Inbound Marketing, Digital Marketing, and Catalogue Advertising. 
* Detailed strategy to address the four concerns of Kevin LaSalle(CFO) and the three concerns of Mark Baxter(CMO).
